# Snake Game AI: q-learning

Originally completed for school: Jul 2021

The purpose of this assignment is to practice implementing a simple reinforcement learning algorithm.
In this case we used q-learning. 

## How to run the game
Download a zip of repository and make sure that the files: `board.py`, `game.py`, `helper.py`, `model.npy`, `snake_agent.py` are present in the current directory. 

Open the directory you saved the files in terminal and run `python3 game.py`.

Once the command is done, `TRAINING NUMBER : #` will begin incrementing on the terminal screen. This is showing how many simulated games are being played. 

Eventually there will be a new pop up window with the snake game showing the results of the training. The snake game will continue to run until the AI has failed to make the next best move.
